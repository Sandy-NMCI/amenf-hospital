    question: "What is the difference between lease and licence agreement?",
    answer:
      "A Lease Agreement gives a party exclusive possession of hospital space for a fixed term and creates a legal interest in the property. It is usually long-term and harder to terminate, with rent paid regularly. \n A Licence Agreement only gives permission to use hospital space or facilities without transferring ownership or interest. It is usually short-term, easier to revoke, and a licence fee is paid instead of rent.",
  },
  {
    question: "How ownership of property is acquired by a person?",
    answer:
      "Ownership of a property can be acquired through various legal methods such as purchasing it via a registered sale deed, receiving it as a gift through a registered gift deed, inheriting it under a Will or succession laws, getting it allotted or auctioned by the government, or by transfer through a trust, society or company. Proper registration and compliance with land-use and healthcare regulations are essential to make the ownership valid.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can a registered will be rectified or changed?",
    answer:
      "Yes. A person can change or cancel their registered Will at any time during their lifetime, as long as they are mentally competent. This is done by making a new Will or by executing a Codicil (an official amendment) and getting it registered. The latest valid Will automatically overrides earlier Wills.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "Is the certified copy of a registered will available to anybody?",

      "No. A certified copy of a registered Will is not available to the public during the testator’s lifetime. Only after the testator’s death, and upon submission of the death certificate, can legal heirs or interested parties apply to the Sub-Registrar’s office to obtain a certified copy.",
