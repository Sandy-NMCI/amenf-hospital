    challenge:
      "Sub-Saharan Africa faces a severe shortage of healthcare professionals, a crisis that affects not only the continent but also global health. With just two medical doctors per 10,000 people, official estimates indicate a current deficit of 2.4 million doctors—a ticking time bomb for the world.",
    solution:
      "AMENF's mission is to address this shortage by offering tuition-free medical education through an innovative curriculum integrating primary care, community medicine, telemedicine, and AI diagnostics.",
    mauritiusAdvantage:
      "Mauritius was chosen for its sub-Saharan African identity, democratic stability, and peaceful environment. It boasts 27.13 doctors per 10,000 people—the highest in Africa—compared to the regional average of 2.",
    sustainability:
      "We have developed an economic rationale and a strategic plan to ensure the project's financial sustainability and autonomy. Establishing a medical facility in Mauritius entails significantly lower costs compared to similar ventures in the United States and Europe.",
